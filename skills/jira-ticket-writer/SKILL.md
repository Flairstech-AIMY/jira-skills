description: Convert rough notes, chat messages, customer requests, technical observations, and partially formed requirements into concise Jira-ready Stories, Tasks, Bugs, or investigation items. Use when the user asks to write, create, rewrite, structure, or clean up a Jira issue, or asks whether something should be a story, task, or bug. Preserve provided facts, links, terminology, urgency, and intent. Do not invent requirements, owners, priorities, estimates, implementation details, or evidence that the user did not provide.

# Jira Ticket Writer

Turn messy input into a Jira issue that a product, engineering, QA, or DevOps team can act on immediately.

## Core Rules

- Preserve the user's intent and all confirmed facts.
- Keep the ticket concise. Remove filler, repetition, conversational phrasing, and unnecessary background.
- Do not invent missing behavior, technical details, dates, severity, assignees, estimates, or acceptance criteria that are not supported by the input.
- Preserve supplied URLs and references exactly unless the user explicitly asks to clean them.
- Prefer testable outcomes over implementation instructions.
- Keep terminology consistent with the user's product names and domain language.
- Make urgency visible when the user explicitly states it, but do not assign a Jira priority unless asked.
- If a material requirement is genuinely unknown, use `TBD` or an `Open Questions` section rather than guessing.
- Do not add sections that contain no useful information.

## Choose the Issue Type

Use the issue type requested by the user when one is explicitly specified.

Otherwise:

- **Story**: A user, customer, admin, agent, or other actor gains a capability or experiences a behavior change that delivers product value.
- **Bug**: Existing behavior is incorrect, broken, inconsistent with intended behavior, or has regressed.
- **Task**: Internal technical work, implementation work, maintenance, configuration, migration, cleanup, or a concrete engineering deliverable without a standalone user-value story.
- **Investigation / Spike**: The primary objective is to discover a cause, validate feasibility, or answer an unresolved technical question. Use this only when the Jira project supports such an issue type. Otherwise use a Task and make the investigation objective explicit.

When the user asks whether something is a Story or Task, explain the distinction briefly and select based on the rules above.

## Workflow

1. Identify the requested outcome.
2. Extract only confirmed context, behavior, impact, constraints, examples, and references.
3. Select the issue type.
4. Remove duplicated or low-value information.
5. Structure the ticket using the most appropriate template below.
6. Write acceptance criteria that describe observable completion conditions.
7. Check that every acceptance criterion is supported by the stated requirement.
8. Check that no supplied reference or important edge case was lost.

## Story Format

Use this structure when the issue is a Story. Omit optional sections when unnecessary.

```markdown
# [Concise title]

## User Story
As a [actor],
I want [capability or behavior],
so that [user or business outcome].

## Problem
[What is missing or failing today and why it matters.]

## Requirements
- [Required behavior]
- [Required behavior]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [Observable, testable result]
- [Observable, testable result]

## Examples
[Only include scenarios that materially clarify the behavior.]

## References
- [Provided reference]
```

Do not force an `As a / I want / so that` sentence when it would be artificial. For highly technical stories, a clear objective may be better.

## Task Format

```markdown
# [Concise title]

## Objective
[Concrete technical or operational outcome.]

## Context
[Only the context needed to understand why the task exists.]

## Scope
- [Required work]
- [Required work]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [Observable completion condition]
- [Observable completion condition]

## References
- [Provided reference]
```

## Bug Format

```markdown
# [Concise title]

## Problem
[Concise description of the defect.]

## Impact
[Who or what is affected, using only provided information.]

## Actual Behavior
[What currently happens.]

## Expected Behavior
[What should happen.]

## Reproduction / Conditions
[Known trigger, environment, sequence, or conditions. Omit if unknown.]

## Evidence
[Logs, screenshots, IDs, links, examples, timestamps, or other supplied evidence.]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [The defect no longer occurs under the known condition.]
- [Expected behavior is verified.]

## References
- [Provided reference]
```

## Acceptance Criteria Rules

Write acceptance criteria that are:

- observable;
- testable;
- tied directly to the requirement;
- concise;
- free of invented thresholds or technical design choices.

Prefer:

`When a contact has multiple profiles with different names, AiMY asks the caller to identify themselves before selecting a profile.`

Avoid:

`Implement robust profile detection with best practices.`

## Style

- Lead with the actual work or user problem.
- Prefer short sections and bullets.
- Avoid generic phrases such as `improve the user experience` unless the concrete improvement is also stated.
- Avoid unnecessary introductions and conclusions.
- Avoid repeating the same requirement in Problem, Requirements, and Acceptance Criteria with identical wording.
- Keep useful examples because they often remove ambiguity faster than more prose.
- Keep future enhancements separate from current scope when the user distinguishes them.

## Final Quality Check

Before returning the ticket, verify:

- The issue type matches the nature of the work.
- The title describes the outcome or defect, not the conversation about it.
- The problem and scope are understandable without the original chat.
- No unsupported assumptions were introduced.
- Acceptance criteria are testable.
- Important examples and references remain intact.
- The result is ready to paste into Jira.
